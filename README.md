# RobotSummer
This repo has the code we used for robot summer where we programmed an autonomous robot to drive around a tape path and collect cans. We programmed a STM32 board using Platform.IO as our IDE and C++ as the principle coding language. 

Accomplishments: 
- Implementation of the PID code increased speed and steering accuracy cutting down drive time from 40s to 21s for an 8m x 8m tape path.
- Improved accuracy of the can detection using IR sensors and efficient coding algorithms
- Implemented skycrane code where when released from a skycrane the robot decreased it's landing speed when approaching the ground
